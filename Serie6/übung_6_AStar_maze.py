class Maze:
    """
    The given external form of the maze comes as a string, with the following characters:
    '#' stands for a wall tile
    ' ' a space stands for a walkable tile
    'S' stands for the start, this tile exists only once
    'F' stands for a finish, it could exist multiple times or not at all
    The outside of the maze is blocked completely by walls '#'
    The maze is given in multiple lines, spaced by '\n".

    An example generated maze could be:
    #######
    #     #
    # # # #
    #S  # #
    ### # #
    #F  #F#
    #######

    Your representation needs to be suitable to solve the underlying search problem to find the fastest way to
    a finish from the start. After a maze is solved, the solution is returned as a string, replacing the
    empty spaces of the path taken by '*' characters. The optimal solution of the maze problem is one, where
    the amount of '*' characters is minimal, connecting 'S' and one 'F' over tiles that were previously filled with
    spaces ' '. For an unsolvable maze (no 'F' can be reached from the 'S'), no stars should be added!

    The solution for the above example would be:
    #######
    #     #
    # # # #
    #S**# #
    ###*# #
    #F**#F#
    #######


    Task 1: Create an internal representation of your maze (10P)
    Define the maze as a search problem, where the task is to find the shortest path from the start to a finish.
    Encode your search problem as a graph: states are nodes and can be expanded by executing a transition function
    - Define all necessary values for the maze to be representing a search state in the __init__ function,
      this includes also a way to retrieve the path that was taken until here with its costs.
    - Define a transition function, which checks which states are neighboring a given state.
    - Define a solved function, which returns if the maze is solved in its current state
    - Define a function __eq__(other_state) to check efficiently if two search-states are the same!
    - Define a function g() which returns the cost of the path to this state from the start
    - Define a function: to_text() which returns the current state as a text, with the path taken from the 'S'
      replaced by '*' characters

    Task 2: Create the A Algorithm with closed and open list. As a reminder, these are the steps: (6P)
    1. Let the open list be the list of start nodes for the problem (first state of the maze after initialization)
    2. If the open list is empty, report a failure by returning an empty list. Otherwise, select the node n from the
       open list for which f(n) = g(n) + h(n) is minimal, g(n) being the costs of the path from start to this node,
       and h(n) the estimated costs from this state to the closest goal state by your heuristic.
    3. If the current node n represents a goal node, report success and return the solution path from the start_state to
       goal as a list of tuples.
    4. Otherwise, remove n from open_list (and add it to the set of already visited nodes) and add all its successor
       nodes to the open_list, if they weren't already. Update the successor nodes with the path to the start node.
    5. Continue with step 2!

    Question (2P): A becomes A* for an admissible heuristics. Does A* return always the optimal solution first even if
    it won't use a closed list to keep track of all already visited states? Explain your answer!
